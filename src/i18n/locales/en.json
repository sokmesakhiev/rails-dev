I possess a complete set of expertise across the entire software development lifecycle, having architected and built mission-critical systems for various companies. My current focus as a Consultant at OnTheGoSystems is leveraging Ruby on Rails and ReactJS to develop a next-generation, AI-powered translation engine. Critically, my background includes leading the development of highly accurate solutions, such as property valuation APIs (Z1Data), and building core, high-stakes financial infrastructure, including a Payment Gateway and Processor at a major Payment Service Provider (Bongloy Payment PLC). I thrive on combining deep technical proficiency with strategic leadership, serving previously as a Scrum Master and mentor to ensure efficient, high-quality delivery across international teams."
